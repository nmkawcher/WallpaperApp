**Tools and Technology:<br/>** 
***Defendency Injection<br />
Provider For StateManagement,<br />
MVVM(c) as a design pattern.***<br />

**library:<br/>
share_plus: for sharing content with other application <br/>
image_gallery_saver: for saving image in gallery <br/>
permission_handler: for hadling user permission <br/>
flutter_wallpaper_manager: we use it for set image as a wallpaper<br/>
flutter_cache_manager: we use it for managing ceach in our app. though for lack of time i can't implement api cacheing in proper way. but i will implement it as soon as possible.**
<br/>
<br/>
**Note: For lack of time we cann't implement theming,localization , also i can't focus on ui.** 
<br/>
**Upcomming: theming,cache api response,localization,caching(with more organize way) etc.**
