#tools and technology: 
Defendency Injection for reduce Tight Coupeling,
Provider For StateManagement
MVVM(c) as a design pattern.
library:
share_plus: for sharing content with other application
image_gallery_saver: for saving image in gallery
permission_handler: for hadling user permission
flutter_wallpaper_manager: we use it for set image as a wallpaper
flutter_cache_manager: we use it for managing ceach in our app. though for lack of time i can't implement api cacheing in proper way. but i will implement it as soon as possible.

Note: For lack of time we cann't implement theming,localization , also i can't focus on ui. 

upcomming: theming,cache api response,localization,caching(with more organize way) etc.
